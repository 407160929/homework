## 1.实验内容

1. ping另外一台计算机

2. tracert一台服务器

 	2. 申请GitHub账户，下载相关资源

## 2.实验步骤与分析

**1. PING另外一台主机**

> 概括：PING另一台电脑IP用于测试当前主机能否正常连接到另一台电脑的web服务器，检测网络是否畅通以及连接速度。（PING=Packet Internet Groper 英特网包探索器）

> 原理：利用网络上机器IP地址的唯一性，给目标IP地址发送一个数据包，再要求对方返回一个同样大小的数据包来确定两台网络机器是否连接相通，时延是多少

> 关闭防火墙：“此电脑”->“打开设置”->“网络和Internet”->“以太网”->“windows防火墙”->手动关掉“域网络”和“公用网络”.

DOS命令：ipconfig -all得到ip地址，ping+ip开启PING操作

**2. tracert一台服务器**

> tracert 是一个简单的网络诊断工具，可以列出分组经过的路由节点，以及它在IP 网络中每一跳的延迟。

### 1.

> Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the  sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small  and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running  for a relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly  justifying your answer: 
>
> a. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more  appropriate for this application? Why?
>
> b. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in this network comes from such applications as described above. Furthermore, assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the  capacities of each and every link. Is some form of congestion control  needed? Why?

a. packet-switched network. packet-switched network will  make better use of Internet resources, and make data more secure.

b. no, there will not be congestion

### 2

> Metcalfe’s law states the value of a computer network is proportional to  the square of the number of connected users of the system. Let n denote the  number of users in a computer network. Assuming each user sends one message to each of the other users, how many messages will be sent? Does your  answer support Metcalfe’s law?

n*(n-1), yes

### 3

> Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at a link in packets/sec, and let µ denote the link’s transmission rate in packets/sec. Based on the formula for  the total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) derived  in the previous problem, derive a formula for the total delay in terms of a and µ.

queuing delay: a/µ 

transmission delay: 1/µ

total delay: a/µ+1/µ



### P6

> Obtain the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616). Answer the following  questions:
>
> a. Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and server  to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the  server, or both signal the close of a connection?
>
> b. What encryption services are provided by HTTP? 
>
> c. Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given  server? 
>
> d. Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them  if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it  possible that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is  transmitting data via this connection? Explain.

a. 

Unless the request's Connect header field contains a "close" tag, HTTP/1.1 servers can always assume that HTTP/1.1 clients want to maintain a persistent connection. If the server wants to close the connection immediately after sending a response, it should send a Connect header field with "close".  

An HTTP/1.1 client may expect to keep the connection open, but this must be based on whether the server response contains a Connect header field and whether the header field contains "close". If the client does not want to maintain the connection for more requests, it should send a Connect header field with a value of "close".  

If either client or server sends a "close" in the Connect header field, the client request will become the last request for the connection.  

Therefore, either the client or the server can send signaling to notify that the connection is closed  

b.

The HTTP protocol itself has no encryption service.

c.

No, at most two concurrent continuous connections.

d.

One side is shut down and it is impossible for the other side to transfer data over the connection.  

Therefore, the client software should be able to reopen the transport layer connection and retransmit abandoned request sequences without user interaction.  

### P12

```
`fro`m socket import *`
`serverPort = 12000`
`serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)`
`serverSocket.bind(("", serverPort))`
`serverSocket.listen(1)`
`print("The server is ready to receive")`
`while 1:`
    `connectSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()`
    `sentence = connectSocket.recv(1024)`
    `print(sentence.decode())`
    connectSocket.close()`
```
