1 ping另外一台计算机

Linux ping 命令用于检测主机。

执行 ping 指令会使用 ICMP 传输协议，发出要求回应的信息，若远端主机的网络功能没有问题，就会回应该信息，因而得知该主机运作正常。

常用ping命令

（1）ping 127.0.0.1 

127.0.0.1是本地的回环地址，检测TCP/IP协议栈是否正常

（2）ping 本地ip 172.23.0.1

检查网卡是否工作正常

查看本地ip的命令——ifconfig -a

（3）ping 网关地址 10.128.127.254

检查和网关的连接性

查看网关的命令——ip route show

(4) ping 远程网站 www.baidu.com

检查远程连接



2 traceroute一台服务器

在Ubuntu下命令为traceroute

traceroute命令用于追踪数据包在网络上的传输时的全部路径，它默认发送的数据包大小是40字节。通过traceroute我们可以知道信息从你的计算机到互联网另一端的主机是走的什么路径。traceroute通过发送小的数据包到目的设备直到其返回，来测量其需要多长时间。

记录按序列号从1开始，每个纪录就是一跳 ，每跳表示一个网关，我们看到每行有三个时间，单位是 ms，其实就是-q的默认参数。探测数据包向每个网关发送三个数据包后，网关响应后返回的时间；如果您用 traceroute -q 4 www.58.com ，表示向每个网关发送4个数据包。

有时我们traceroute 一台主机时，会看到有一些行是以星号表示的。出现这样的情况，可能是防火墙封掉了ICMP的返回信息，所以我们得不到什么相关的数据包返回数据。

有时我们在某一网关处延时比较长，有可能是某台网关比较阻塞，也可能是物理设备本身的原因。

Problem 2

At time $N*(L/R)$ the first packet has reached the destination, the second packet is stored in the last router, the third packet is stored in the next-to-last router, etc. At time $N*(L/R) + L/R$, the second packet has reached the destination, the third packet is stored in the last router,  etc.  Continuing  with  this  logic,  we  see  that  at  time  $N*(L/R)  +  (P-1)*(L/R)  = (N+P-1)*(L/R)$ all packets have reached the destination.  

Problem 3   

a)  A  circuit-switched  network  would  be  well  suited  to  the  application,  because  the application  involves  long  sessions  with  predictable  smooth  bandwidth  requirements. Since  the  transmission  rate  is  known  and  not  bursty,  bandwidth  can  be  reserved  for each application session without significant waste. In addition, the overhead costs of setting up and tearing down connections are amortized over the lengthy duration of a typical application session.  
b)  In  the  worst  case,  all  the  applications  simultaneously  transmit  over  one  or  more network links. However, since each link has sufficient bandwidth to handle the sum of  all  of  the  applications'  data  rates,  no  congestion  (very little  queuing)  will  occur. Given  such  generous  link  capacities,  the  network  does  not  need  congestion  control mechanisms.

Problem 4  

a) Between the switch in the upper left and the switch in the upper right we can have 4 connections.  Similarly  we  can  have  four  connections  between  each  of  the  3  other pairs of adjacent switches. Thus, this network can support up to 16 connections.   

b) We can 4 connections passing through the switch in the upper-right-hand corner and another  4  connections  passing  through  the  switch  in  the  lower-left-hand  corner, giving a total of 8 connections. 

c) Yes. For the connections between A and C, we route two connections through B and two  connections  through  D.  For  the  connections  between  B  and  D,  we  route  two connections through A and two connections through C.  In this manner, there are at most 4 connections passing through any link.

p2:



SMS  (Short  Message Service) is a technology that allows the sending and  receiving of text  messages  between  mobile  phones  over  cellular  networks.  SMS is  realized  through  the  Mobile  Application  Part  (MAP)  of  the  SS#7  protocol,  and  the Short Message protocol is defined by 3GPP TS 23.040 and 3GPP TS 23.041. In addition, MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) extends the capability of original text messages, and support sending photos, longer text messages, and other content.  

iMessage is  an instant messenger service developed by Apple. iMessage supports texts, photos, audios or videos that we send to iOS devices and Macs over cellular data network or WiFi. Apple’s iMessage is based on a proprietary, binary protocol APNs (Apple Push Notification Service). It sets up a Keep-Alive connection with the Apple servers. Every connection has its own unique code, which acts as an identifier for the route that should be used to send a message to a specific device. The connection is encrypted with TLS using a client-side certificate, that is requested by the device on the activation of iMessage.

WhatsApp  Messenger  is  an  instant  messenger  service  that  supports  many  mobile platforms  such  as  iOS,  Android,  Mobile  Phone,  and  Blackberry.  WhatsApp  users  can send each other unlimited images, texts, audios, or videos over cellular data network or WiFi. WhatsApp uses the XMPP protocol (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). 

WeChat is a Chinese multi-purpose instant messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by Tencent. The application uses a proprietary encryption protocol called as MMTLS for most of its communications. It is designed based on Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 drafts for both performance and security.



iMessage  and  WhatsApp  are  different  from  SMS  because  they  use  data  plan  to  send messages and they work on TCP/IP networks, but SMS use the text messaging plan we purchase from our wireless carrier. Moreover, iMessage and WhatsApp support sending photos,  videos,  files,  etc.,  while the  original SMS  can  only send  text  message.  Finally, iMessage and WhatsApp can work via WiFi, but SMS cannot.

WeChat attaches great importance to security and use encryption protol, which is different from others.
