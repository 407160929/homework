## Week12 Homework

### Chapter 5 Problem 12

+ **Question:**

    Describe how loops in paths can be detected in BGP.

+ **Answer:**

    BGP routers use the AS-PATH attribute to detect and prevent looping advertisements; specifically, if a router sees that its own AS is contained in the path list, it will reject the advertisement.

### Chapter 5 Problem 16

+ **Question:**

    Consider the following network. ISP B provides national backbone service to regional ISP A. ISP C provides national backbone service to regional ISP D. Each ISP consists of one AS. B and C peer with each other in two places using BGP. Consider traffic going from A to D. B would prefer to hand that traffic over to C on the West Coast (so that C would have to absorb the cost of carrying the traffic cross-country), while C would prefer to get the traffic via its East Coast peering point with B (so that B would have carried the traffic across the country). What BGP mechanism might C use, so that B would hand over A-to-D traffic at its East Coast peering point? To answer this question, you will need to dig into the BGP specification.

+ **Answer:**

    C could only advertise its route to D via its east coast peering point with C to force B to hand over A-to-D traffic at its East Coast peering point. 

### Chapter 5 Problem 20

+ **Question:**

    Suppose ASs X and Z are not directly connected but instead are connected by AS Y. Further suppose that X has a peering agreement with Y, and that Y has a peering agreement with Z. Finally, suppose that Z wants to transit all of Y’s traffic but does not want to transit X’s traffic. Does BGP allow Z to implement this policy?

+ **Answer:**

    No, BGP doesn't allow Z to implement this policy. Because if Z wants to transit all of Y's traffic, Z needs to advertise its route(a.b.c.d/x) to Y. However Y could send an eBGP message "Y Z a.b.c.d/x", so X could sending the traffic to Z, and Z couldn't do nothing by BGP not to transit X's traffic.

### Chapter 5 Problem 22

+ **Question:**

    In Section 5.7, we saw that it was preferable to transport SNMP messages in unreliable UDP datagrams. Why do you think the designers of SNMP chose UDP rather than TCP as the transport protocol of choice for SNMP?

+ **Answer:**

    The time most requiring network management is during periods of stress, where the network can be very crowded and packets are being lost. If SNMP is running on TCP, the congestion control of TCP will cause SNMP to back-off and stop sending messages when the network manager needs to send them.
