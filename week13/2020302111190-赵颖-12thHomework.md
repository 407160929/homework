### P20 Solution

Since Z wants to transmit Y's traffic, Z will send a route broadcast to Y in this way. This way, when Y has a datagram to send to an IP that can be reached via Z, Y will have the option to send that datagram via Z. However, if Z forwards routes to Y, Y can relog those routes to X. So, in this case, Z cannot block the transfer from X to Z.
