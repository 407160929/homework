## Week13 Homework

### Chapter 6 Problem 1

+ **Question:**

    Suppose the information content of a packet is the bit pattern 1110 0110 1001 0101 and an even parity scheme is being used. What would the value of the field containing the parity bits be for the case of a two-dimensional parity scheme? Your answer should be such that a minimum-length checksum field is used.

+ **Answer:**

    1 1 1 0 1
    0 1 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1 0
    0 1 0 1 0
    0 1 0 0 1

### Chapter 6 Problem 5

+ **Question:**

    Consider the 5-bit generator, G = 10011, and suppose that D has the value 1010101010. What is the value of R?

+ **Answer:**

  By model-2 dividing 10011 into 1010101010 0000, get R = 0100.
