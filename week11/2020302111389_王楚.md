## P3

> Consider the following network. With the indicated link costs, use Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to compute the shortest path from x to all network nodes. Show how the algorithm works by computing a table similar to Table 4.3.

| N       | D(u),P(u) | D(v),P(v) | D(w),P(w) | D(y),P(y) | D(z),P(z) | D(t),P(t) |

## P5

> Consider the network shown below, and assume that each node initially knows the costs to each of its neighbors. Consider the distance-vector algorithm and show the distance table entries at node z.

|      | u    | v    | x    | y    | z    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| v    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    |
| x    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    | ∞    |
| z    | ∞    | 6    | 2    | ∞    | 0    |

|      | u    | v    | x    | y    | z    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| v    | 1    | 0    | 3    | 3    | 5    |
| x    | 4    | 3    | 0    | 3    | 2    |
| z    | 6    | 5    | 2    | 5    | 0    |

|      | u    | v    | x    | y    | z    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| v    | 1    | 0    | 3    | 3    | 5    |
| x    | 4    | 3    | 0    | 3    | 2    |
| z    | 6    | 5    | 2    | 5    | 0    |



## P6

> Consider the count-to-infinity problem in the distance vector routing. Will the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link? Why? How about if we connect two nodes which do not have a link?

Don't. Such a structure does not form a loop. Loops are usually caused by a sudden increase in link costs
