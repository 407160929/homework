P26. Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not want to upload any data to any other peers (so called free-riding).

a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file that is shared by the swarm. Is Bob’s claim possible? Why or why not?

`it's possible, he can ask other peers to send him the file.`

b. Bob further claims that he can further make his “free-riding” more efficient by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?

`he can do that by asking others to send him the file via his different hosts and IP address.`



P28. Install and compile the Python programs TCPClient and UDPClient on one host and TCPServer and UDPServer on another host.
a. Suppose you run TCPClient before you run TCPServer. What happens? Why?

`"socket.gaierror: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed", because TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, before transmission, client must perform three hand-shaking with the server.`

b. Suppose you run UDPClient before you run UDPServer. What happens? Why?

`it operates successfully, because UDP don't need to activate server before client.`

c. What happens if you use different port numbers for the client and server sides?

` during TCP connection an error will occur, during UDP connection server willnot receive the request.`
