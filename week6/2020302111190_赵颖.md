## Problem 3

### solution：

01010011+01100110=10111001，10111001+01110100=100101101

ignore the extra bit :00101101,and the 1s complement is 11010010

UDP take 1s complement of the sum for check data .In this way,the UDP can check by adding the data with the checksum.The UDP dose not take sum for more convenient coculating.

The UDP add the sum and the data bits .If there is 0 in the result ,it detect the error.

It is impossible that 1-bit error will go undetected;but it is possible that 2-bit errot will go undetected.
