*What is the difference between MAIL FROM: in SMTP and From: in the mail
message itself?*

`From:` in the mail message is the part of the mail message itself. This field
represents the sender of the message.  
Whereas `MAIL FROM:` is one of the SMTP protocol commands. SMTP client sends the
e-mail address of the sender of the message to SMTP server using the command
`MAIL FROM:` while SMTP handshaking phase.

## Chapter 2, P20

*Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department.
Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers (outside
your department) that are most popular among the users in your department?
Explain.*

DNS records are cached by DNS servers for a certain period of time (which is the
TTL of that record) when a record is being queried by its clients. Therefore we
can inspect the cache regularly (for example, inspect once every 10 seconds),
and count DNS names appeared in A/AAAA/CNAME records in the cache. The DNS name
which appears the most will probably be the most popular web server.
