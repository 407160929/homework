## The Second Homework

### Problem 15

> What is the difference between MAIL FROM: in SMTP and From: in the mail message itself?

MAIL FROM: in SMTP is a message from the SMTP client that identifies the sender of the mail message to the SMTP server. From: on the mail message itself is NOT an SMTP message, but rather is just a line in the body of the mail message.

### Problem 20

> Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your depart- ment. Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers (outside your department) that are most popular among the users in your department? Explain.



We can periodically take a snapshot of the DNS caches in the local DNS servers. The Web server that appears most frequently in the DNS caches is the most popular server. This is because if more users are interested in a Web server, then DNS requests for that server are more frequently sent by users. Thus, that Web server will appear in the DNS caches more frequently.
