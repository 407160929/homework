P15
MTA is a mail transfer agent. 
The host can send a message to the MTA and send it to the destination host via a series of MTAS.
An honest MTA should report the source of the email.
In this email, "asusus-4b96 ([58.88.21.177]) does not report where the email was received. 
Since we assume that only the initiator is dishonest," asusus-4b96 ([58.88.21.177]) is the initiator.

P20
Yes. 
For example, we can do this: 
Count the web server IP in the cache every hour, and then count the data for 7 days.
The server with the most frequent occurrence is the most popular web server.
Explainï¼š
This is because if more users are interested in the web server, DNS server requests will be interested, and the server will be sent by users more frequently.
Therefore, the web server will appear in the DNS cache more frequently.
