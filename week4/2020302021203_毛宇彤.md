P15. Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at a link in packets/sec, and let μ
denote the link’s transmission rate in packets/sec. Based on the formula for
the total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) derived
in the previous problem, derive a formula for the total delay in terms of a
and μ.

$d_{total}=\frac{1}{μ}+\frac{1}{a}$

P20. Consider the throughput example corresponding to Figure 1.20(b). Now
suppose that there are M client-server pairs rather than 10. Denote Rs, Rc,
and R for the rates of the server links, client links, and network link. Assume
all other links have abundant capacity and that there is no other traffic in the
network besides the traffic generated by the M client-server pairs. Derive a
general expression for throughput in terms of Rs, Rc, R, and M.
