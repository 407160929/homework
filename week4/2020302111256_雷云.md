### Chapter 2 Problem 20

**question:**

Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department. Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers (outside your department) that are most popular among the users in your department? Explain.

**Answer:**

+ I can copy the DNS cache in the local DNS server at fixed period. The web server that show up most frequently in the DNS cache is the most popular server.
