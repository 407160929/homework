> P20. Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department. Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers (outside  your department) that are most popular among the users in your department?  Explain

Yes. We can record the Web servers that appears in the DNS caches in the local DNS servers every hour. After 24 hours, the server that appears most frequently is the most popular server. The reason is that when users connect to a Web server, the DNS requests for that server will be sent by users, and then the Web server will appear in the DNS caches. So, the server that appears in the DNS caches most frequently is the most popular server.
