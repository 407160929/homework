## P15
MTA represents the mail transfer agent.  
The host sends the message to the MTA. The message then follows a series of MTAS to reach the recipient's mail reader.  
We see that this spam follows an MTA chain.  
An honest MTA should report where it received the message.  
In this message, "asusus-4b96 ([58.88.21.177])" does not report where it received the email.  
Assuming that the originator of this email is malacious and other hosts are honest, this email can only be generated by malacious hosts.

## P20
We can take a snapshot of the DNS cache in the local DNS server on a regular basis.  
The organization's most frequent web server in the DNS cache is the most popular server.  
This is because if more users are interested in the web server, DNS server requests will be interested, and the server will be sent by users more frequently.  
Therefore, the web server will appear in the DNS cache more frequently.
